## 1) HTML stands for (HyperText Markup Language)

HTMLis the standard markup language for texts that are intended to be viewed on a web browser. Technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and programming languages like JavaScript can help.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or locally stored files and convert them to multimedia web pages.Web browsers translate HTML documents received from a web server or locally saved files into multimedia web pages.

## 2) HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser

 HTML markup includes special "elements" such as `<head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>` and many others.

 The main parts of our element are as follows:

#### The opening tag

This is made up of the element's name (in this case, p) surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets. This specifies the point at which the element begins to take effect — in this case, the beginning of the paragraph.

#### The closing tag

This is the same as the opening tag, except the element name is preceded by a forward slash. This specifies the point at which the element — in this case, the paragraph — comes to an end. One of the most common novice mistakes is failing to add a closing tag, which might result in unexpected effects.

#### The Element content

This is the element's content, which is merely text in this case.

#### The element

The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
