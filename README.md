<h5>A growth mentality is a way of looking at problems and failures. People with a growth mindset feel that their abilities aren't fixed, even if they struggle with specific tasks. They believe that by working hard, their abilities would increase with time.
People with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities are what they are and will not change. They believe that their abilities will not have an impact.
Having a growth mentality has a lot of advantages. It enables people to redefine their approach to problems and stay motivated to develop their abilities. They think, rather than "I can't do this," "I can't do it yet."
The concept of a growth mentality isn't a new one. Carol Dweck and her colleagues conducted research that led to this conclusion. Their study focused on children. Adults, too, can benefit from the concept.
A lot of research has been done on growth mentality. However, there are still some misunderstandings regarding what it is and isn't. Here are some frequent falsehoods â€“ and their counter-arguments.</h5>

__Myth 1__: *It's either there or it's not. This is not the case. We all have a combination of fixed and growth mindsets that evolve throughout time as a result of our experiences and feedback.*

__Myth 2__: *Having a growth mindset is all about being optimistic. There's a lot more to it than that. Having a growth mindset entails listening to feedback, learning from mistakes, and devising tactics to improve.*

__Myth 3__: *Praise helps people have a growth mindset. It depends on what you're complimenting. Not how hard a someone worked or how successful they were, but how they addressed a situation is what matters.*
