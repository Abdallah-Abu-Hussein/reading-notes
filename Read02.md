## What is Git ?
short answer it's a _*version control system*_
## What is a _*version control system*_ ?:thinking:
A version control system is a type of software that enables the development team in quickly communicating and managing(tracking) all changes made to the source code, as well as information such as who made a change and what it was. 
Every contributor who made the modifications has their own branch, and the changes are not really merged into the original source code until all of them have been analyzed. Once all of the changes have been green signaled, they are merged into the main source code. It not only organizes source code but also enhances programmer productivityÂ by streamlining the development process.

### version control system Types :
**Centralized Version Control Systems**: Each user has their own working copy in centralized version control systems because there is only one repository. You must commit to updating the repository with your changes.

**Distributed Version Control Systems**: Multiple repositories are included in distributed version control systems. Each user has their own working copy and repository. Simply committing your changes does not grant anyone access to them. This is because commit will only reflect those changes in your local repository, and you'll need to push them to the central repository to see them.. Similarly, until you have previously pulled other people's modifications into your repository, you do not get other people's changes when you update.

## So Git is ....
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that saves data in a snapshot-based file system. Git produces a snapshot of the file and keeps a reference to it every time you commit a revised version of your project. Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of the file if it hasn't changed.

we can say Git is by far the most popular modern version control system in use today. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project created by Linus Torvalds, the well-known developer of the Linux operating system kernel, in 2005.

## Is Git the only System out there ..?
When compared to several competitors, Git's raw overall performance are very strong. The performance of committing new changes, branching, merging, and comparing previous versions is all optimized. Git's algorithms make use of extensive knowledge on the common characteristics of real source code file trees, as well as how they are typically modified over time and how they are accessed.
