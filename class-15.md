# Reading 14b: What Google Learned About Teams

### "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team"

#### Google's Original Conclusions

* Google's conclusions after studying 180 teams for over a year:
  - **Group norms** seemed to matter the most to team dynamics/success
  - Group norms are essentially the social rules that govern behavior while coming together in groups
  - However, group norms were *not* the same across all groups

#### Key Takeaways from the Study

* "Teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything."
- These teams were all different, too - in terms of their interactions, workflow, etc.
- The key was: **how teams treated one another**

* Regardless of the team makeup/modus operandi, the "right norms" could help a team excel and increase their collective intelligence
  - The "wrong norms" could hinder a team regardless of intelligence


#### Common Indicators of "Strong" Teams
1. Members spoke roughly the same proportion ("equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking")
  - As long as everyone got chances to speak, the team functioned well
  - Teams that had one person/small group talking all the time were less "collectively intelligent"

2. Teams had high "average social sensitivity"
  - A.K.A., could pick up on how others on the team felt based off of verbal and nonverbal cues
  - Could sense when members were upset or left out

#### Psychological Safety

* Teams created a safe environment for "interpersonal risk-taking" - known as 
**psychological safety**


## Not all researchers agree
While Google’s findings may be true to some extent, a large number of scientific studies have caused researchers (outside of Google’s lab) to shockingly disagree. They claim the exact opposite — that personality, not just skills, is indeed a significant factor in what makes a team successful.

Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at Columbia University and author of the book “Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders? (and How to Fix It),” and psychologist Dave Winsborough, former VP at Hogan Assessment Systems, argue personality, in particular, heavily affects the role of an individual within a team.
