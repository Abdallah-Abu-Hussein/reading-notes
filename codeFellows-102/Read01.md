# Markdown language for a non-technical friend

## 1. What's Markdown language ?

Markdown is a simple markup language that can be used to add formatting to plaintext text documents. Markdown, which was created by John Gruber in 2004, is currently one of the most widely used markup languages in the world.
In a program like Microsoft Word, you may format words and sentences by clicking buttons, and the changes are immediately visible.That isn't the case with Markdown. soÂ When creating a Markdown-formatted document, you use Markdown syntax to designate which words and phrases should be formatted differently.

## 2. Why using Markdown ?

* Markdown is a future-proof language. You'll be able to view your Markdown-formatted material using a text editing application even if the application you're using stops working in the future. When it comes to books, university theses, and other essential materials that must be saved indefinitely, this is a critical factor.
* Markdown is all over the place. Markdown is supported by several desktop and web-based apps, including Reddit and GitHub.
* Everything can be written in Markdown. Websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation are all created with it.

## 3. How Dose it work ?

Markdown applications employ a Markdown processor (also known as a "parser" or "implementation") to convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML format. Your document can then be viewed in a web browser or printed after being integrated with a style sheet. A visual illustration of this procedure can be found below.

## some cool examples on using markdown language

* For the font to be bold you use(`*`) before the text like this :  

`*`This text will be bold`*` =

__This will also be bold__

* For the font to be Italic you can use (`**`)

`**`This text will be bold`**` before the text like this :
__This will also be bold__

* If you want to add to do-List you can do it with `-[x]` like this and it will look like this :

`- [x]` list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
* [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
* [x] this is a complete item
* [ ] this is an incomplete item
