## First **Loops**

### Here we are gonig to cover only `for` and `while` loops

## For Loops

`for ([initialization]); [condition]; [final-expression])`

`{`

  `// code`

`}`

### Description

* __initialization__ - Performed before the loop's first iteration. Counters are frequently created using this expression. Variables generated in this section are limited to the loop. They are deleted once the loop has completed its iteration.

* __condition__ - An expression that is tested before each repetition begins. If this expression is left blank, it translates to true. The loop's statement is executed if it evaluates to true. The loop ends if it evaluates to false.

* __final-expression__ - After each iteration, this expression is run. Typically used to increase the value of a counter. However, it can also be used to decrement a counter.

* __statement__ - The code that will be repeated in a loop.

## While loops

The condition is evaluated first in the while loop. The statement(s) is/are performed if the condition is true. The statement(s) is/are not performed if the condition is false, and the while loop terminates. While loops are worth paying attention to since if the false condition is never satisfied, you'll end up with an endless loop. An infinite loop might cause your program or browser to break.

`while (condition)`

`{`

  `code;`

`}`

## Second __Operators__

Operators are included in JavaScript, just as they are in other languages. An operator provides a result by performing an action on a single or more operands (data value). For example, 1 + 2 is an operator with 1 as the left operand and 2 as the right operand. The + operator adds two numeric numbers, yielding a result of 3, in this example.

### Some famous ones

`== equal to`

`=== equal value and equal type`

`!= not equal`

`!== not equal value or not equal type`

`> greater than`

`< less than`

`>= greater than or equal to`

`<= less than or equal to`

`? ternary operator`
