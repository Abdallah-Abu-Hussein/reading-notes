## Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy T. Fielding, Senior Principal Scientist at Adobe, is known for his pioneering work on the World Wide Web, open source, and software architecture. He wrote the standards for HTTP/1. x and URI, has been a contributor to many other Web technologies, and defined the REST architectural style.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren’t designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn’t have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The familiar HTTP acronym at the start of Web addresses is the standard — or protocol — for transferring documents. Fielding was a principal author of the version still in use

## What does a `GET` do?

GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.

## What does a `POST` do?

POST is a request method supported by HTTP used by the World Wide Web. By design, the POST request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it. It is often used when uploading a file or when submitting a completed web form.

## What does `PUT` do?

The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.

## What does `PATCH` do?

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource. PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused). A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource
