# NODE.JS
## An Introduction to Node.js

## **1- What is node.js?**

Node.js is an open-source (Links to an external site.), cross-platform (Links to an external site.), back-end (Links to an external site.) JavaScript (Links to an external site.) runtime environment (Links to an external site.) that runs on the V8 engine (Links to an external site.) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser (Links to an external site.). 

## **2- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript (Links to an external site.) and WebAssembly (Links to an external site.), and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

## **3- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

The Node. js runtime is the software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies and running your service.

## **4- What is npm?**

npm is two things: first and foremost, 1. it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; 2. second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

## **5- What version of node are you running on your machine?**

v14.17.3

## **6- What version of npm are you running on your machine?** 

6.14.13

## **7- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

npm install -g jshint

## **8- What is node used for?**

Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
