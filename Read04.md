## 1) what is it ?
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for a variety of purposes, including web development, web apps, game creation, and more. It enables you to add dynamic features to web sites that you couldn't do with just HTML and CSS.

## 2) Javascript and HTML
Javascript is what makes a web page interactive ,The structure of your online document, as well as the content within it, is defined by HTML. CSS specifies different styles for the contents of a web document. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamic programming language that allows you to do things like do math computations, generate dynamic style declarations, and fetch content from other websites. 
we can use Javascript in HTML in many ways like :
* Internal JavaScript with the script tag
Just like the style tag for style declarations within an HTML page, the script tag exists for JavaScript. Here's how it's used:

`<script>
	function(){
	    alert("I am inside a script tag")
	}
</script>`

* External JavaScript
You may want to have your JavaScript code in a different file. External JavaScript allows this. For such uses-cases, here's how it's done:

`<script src="./script.js">
</script>    
alert("I am inside an external file");`

The src attribute of the script tag allows you to apply a source for the JavaScript code. That reference is important because it notifies the browser to also fetch the content of script.js.

## 3) How to talk to the user 
The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.

An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

`alert("Hello\nHow are you?");`
